                  Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and
                  released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode
                  versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and
                  game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative
                  shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off
                  zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications
                  they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle
                  royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last
                  person standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are
                  given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.

                  Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter
                  developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Described
                  as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams
                  of six, with each player selecting from a roster of over 30
                  characters, known as "heroes", each with a unique style of
                  play that is divided into three general roles that fit their
                  purpose.
