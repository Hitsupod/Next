                  Metro 2033 Redux is a top-class first-person shooter/survival horror game, a breathless experience.Artyom's desperate, 
                  haunting voyage through the irradiated remains of Moscow is every bit as engaging today as it was when it first released 
                  back in 2010, and this Redux version benefits massively from overhauled AI, gameplay mechanics and visuals. 
                  In terms of first-person shooters or survival horror games on Nintendo's console, this is one of the very best.

                Battlefield V is focused extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing 
                "abstractions" from game mechanics to increase realism. There is an expanded focus on player customization through 
                the new Company system, where players can create multiple characters with cosmetic and weapon options. Cosmetic items, 
                and currency used to purchase others, are earned by completing in-game objectives.
